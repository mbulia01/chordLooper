Project: ChordLooper
Author: Max Bulian

Purpose:

This apps main intention is to provide the user to be able pick out chords and
personalize their own chord progressions with just the touch of a button. There is a
picker that provides the user with all of the available options for chords. When a button
is pressed, the chord that is highlighted in the picker will be put in that spot in the
chord progression.

When the user is ready to play, he can just press the play button and their chord
progression will be played back on repeat until they want it to stop! So what is the purpose of an app that plays chords for you?

When practicing guitar, it is often helpful to play over different songs/melodies/chords.
This will make the guitar player more versatile. Each different chord progression may
have a different feel, so the guitarist will have to adjust the key they are playing in,
the tone of the music they play etc. The ChordLooper allows the guitarist to switch keys
very easily, so if a guitarist feels like they have had enough practice soloing over
their Em chord progression, they can make one in Am to change it up.
